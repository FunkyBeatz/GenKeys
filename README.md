# 🔑 Secure Key Generator

A simple and practical project I created while learning to code—because doing yet another "Hello World" wasn't my style! 😉

## ✨ Features
- Generates random, secure keys with 20 characters
- Mixed uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
- Keys are neatly formatted with dashes for readability

## 🛠️ Usage
Generate a random key like this:
`ABC12-def34-GHI56-jkl78-MNO90`


## 🚀 Why?
I wanted to build something quick, useful, and more interesting than traditional beginner projects. This small tool showcases my learning journey and provides a handy utility for secure key generation.
